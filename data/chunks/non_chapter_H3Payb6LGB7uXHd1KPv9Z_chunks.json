However, some experts reduce ponatinib to 30 mg for AP CML for BCR-ABL1 <1 percent [35]. Many clinicians co- administer aspirin to mitigate CV complications of ponatinib, but this has not been shown to be beneficial. ¢ Adverse effects - Treatment with ponatinib is associated with CV AEs in more than one- fifth of patients, arterial thrombosis in 8 percent, and liver toxicity/failure is possible [36,37]. * Outcomes - A phase 2 study (PACE) reported outcomes with ponatinib in 83 patients with AP CML (resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib), including patients with BCR-ABL1 T315I mutations [38].

However, some experts reduce ponatinib to 30 mg for AP CML for BCR-ABL1 <1 percent [35]. Many clinicians co- administer aspirin to mitigate CV complications of ponatinib, but this has not been shown to be beneficial. ¢ Adverse effects - Treatment with ponatinib is associated with CV AEs in more than one- fifth of patients, arterial thrombosis in 8 percent, and liver toxicity/failure is possible [36,37]. * Outcomes - A phase 2 study (PACE) reported outcomes with ponatinib in 83 patients with AP CML (resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib), including patients with BCR-ABL1 T315I mutations [38].",

As examples, single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions (indels) in RUNX71 and ASXL17, plus IKZF1 exon deletions; mutations of epigenetic regulators; and gene fusions involving RUNX1, MLL (KMT2A), and CBFB are common in AP CML [56,57].

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5\" to 6\" grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.
