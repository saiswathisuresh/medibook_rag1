      "text": "2 15 Cancer Screening negative HPV can serve to further space out the interval needed for cervical screening to every 3 years. Currently, in the United States, the HPV test is not recommended as a stand alone screening test; however there are ongoing large prospective trials to further elucidate a role in screening. For example, 44,000 women in the Netherlands have already enrolled in POBASCAM (population-based randomized controlled trial for implementation of high risk HPV testing in cervical cancer screening) that will help determine whether HPV testing can supplant cervical cytology.8 In the near future, perhaps the advent of the new HPV vaccines may change the screening recommendations but further data will be required before any alterations are endorsed. Two companies have demonstrated exciting advances in the ability of HPV vaccines (one targeted against HPV 16 and 18, another against HPV Types 16, 18, 6 and 11) to prevent HPV infection and subsequent cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia. Multiple questions remain including, whether universal vaccinations will be recom- mended and who will pay for them, the length of protection that is aff orded by the vaccinations and how Pap tests will be performed in the vaccinated population.",

In summary, cervical cancer screening with a Pap test is still recommended every 1-3 years in all women starting at 3 years aft er initiation of sexual activity but no later than age 21. Screening can be discontinued following hysterectomy for benign reasons, not including cervical dysplasia, or for women over 70 without risk factors. Ovarian Cancer Screening An eff ective screening test is needed more in ovarian cancer than perhaps in any other gynecologic malignancy. Ovarian cancer will strike about 22,000 U.S. women in 2008 and an estimated 15,000 will succumb to the disease.1 Unfortunately, the high mortality due to the disease can be directly attributed to the fact that the 75-80% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer will have Stage III and IV disease. Overall 5-year survival for women with Stage III and IV disease are 30% and 17% respectively compared to 80-90% fi ve-year survival for women with Stage I disease.",

Other high risk types include 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73 and 82.37 Low risk types that may cause dysplasia or condylomas include types 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81. HPV is a circular double stranded DNA virus that contains 7 early (E1-E7) and 2 late (L1-L2) open read frames. E6 and E7 oncoproteins maintain the transformed phenotype and interact with tumor suppressor gene products. E6 proteins inactivate the p53 gene product, while E7 activates the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product (Fig. 1.3). In conclusion, understanding the molecular basis of tumor carcinogenesis al- lows for exciting development of cancer prevention and targeted therapies. Tumor “signatures” to predict responses to therapy and to identify novel tumor markers are under current investigation using microarray and proteomic technologies.

Currently, in the United States, the HPV test is not recommended as a stand alone screening test; however there are ongoing large prospective trials to further elucidate a role in screening. For example, 44,000 women in the Netherlands have already enrolled in POBASCAM (population-based randomized controlled trial for implementation of high risk HPV testing in cervical cancer screening) that will help determine whether HPV testing can supplant cervical cytology.8 In the near future, perhaps the advent of the new HPV vaccines may change the screening recommendations but further data will be required before any alterations are endorsed. Two companies have demonstrated exciting advances in the ability of HPV vaccines (one targeted against HPV 16 and 18, another against HPV Types 16, 18, 6 and 11) to prevent HPV infection and subsequent cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.",

Multiple questions remain including, whether universal vaccinations will be recom- mended and who will pay for them, the length of protection that is aff orded by the vaccinations and how Pap tests will be performed in the vaccinated population. In summary, cervical cancer screening with a Pap test is still recommended every 1-3 years in all women starting at 3 years aft er initiation of sexual activity but no later than age 21. Screening can be discontinued following hysterectomy for benign reasons, not including cervical dysplasia, or for women over 70 without risk factors. Ovarian Cancer Screening An eff ective screening test is needed more in ovarian cancer than perhaps in any other gynecologic malignancy. Ovarian cancer will strike about 22,000 U.S. women in 2008 and an estimated 15,000 will succumb to the disease.1 Unfortunately, the high mortality due to the disease can be directly attributed to the fact that the 75-80% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer will have Stage III and IV disease.",

Overall 5-year survival for women with Stage III and IV disease are 30% and 17% respectively compared to 80-90% fi ve-year survival for women with Stage I disease. To date, there is not an accepted or recommended screening regimen for women with ovarian cancer although several modalities have been in screening trials for years including transvaginal ultrasonography, CA125 testing and, more recently, serum proteonomics. Currently, neither the American Cancer Society, nor the USPSTF, nor ACOG recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer. Part of the diffi culty in proving the effi cacy of a screening method stems from the low prevalence of the disease in the general population.

Currently, there is no recommended screening test for endometrial cancer in the general population, but if abnormal bleeding is reported, prompt evaluation with an endometrial biopsy and/or pelvic ultrasound is of paramount importance.

Other high risk types include 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73 and 82.37 Low risk types that may cause dysplasia or condylomas include types 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81. HPV is a circular double stranded DNA virus that contains 7 early (E1-E7) and 2 late (L1-L2) open read frames. E6 and E7 oncoproteins maintain the transformed phenotype and interact with tumor suppressor gene products. E6 proteins inactivate the p53 gene product, while E7 activates the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product (Fig. 1.3). In conclusion, understanding the molecular basis of tumor carcinogenesis al- lows for exciting development of cancer prevention and targeted therapies. Tumor “signatures” to predict responses to therapy and to identify novel tumor markers are under current investigation using microarray and proteomic technologies.

Currently, in the United States, the HPV test is not recommended as a stand alone screening test; however there are ongoing large prospective trials to further elucidate a role in screening. For example, 44,000 women in the Netherlands have already enrolled in POBASCAM (population-based randomized controlled trial for implementation of high risk HPV testing in cervical cancer screening) that will help determine whether HPV testing can supplant cervical cytology.8 In the near future, perhaps the advent of the new HPV vaccines may change the screening recommendations but further data will be required before any alterations are endorsed. Two companies have demonstrated exciting advances in the ability of HPV vaccines (one targeted against HPV 16 and 18, another against HPV Types 16, 18, 6 and 11) to prevent HPV infection and subsequent cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.",

Multiple questions remain including, whether universal vaccinations will be recom- mended and who will pay for them, the length of protection that is aff orded by the vaccinations and how Pap tests will be performed in the vaccinated population. In summary, cervical cancer screening with a Pap test is still recommended every 1-3 years in all women starting at 3 years aft er initiation of sexual activity but no later than age 21. Screening can be discontinued following hysterectomy for benign reasons, not including cervical dysplasia, or for women over 70 without risk factors. Ovarian Cancer Screening An eff ective screening test is needed more in ovarian cancer than perhaps in any other gynecologic malignancy. Ovarian cancer will strike about 22,000 U.S. women in 2008 and an estimated 15,000 will succumb to the disease.1 Unfortunately, the high mortality due to the disease can be directly attributed to the fact that the 75-80% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer will have Stage III and IV disease.",

Overall 5-year survival for women with Stage III and IV disease are 30% and 17% respectively compared to 80-90% fi ve-year survival for women with Stage I disease. To date, there is not an accepted or recommended screening regimen for women with ovarian cancer although several modalities have been in screening trials for years including transvaginal ultrasonography, CA125 testing and, more recently, serum proteonomics. Currently, neither the American Cancer Society, nor the USPSTF, nor ACOG recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer. Part of the diffi culty in proving the effi cacy of a screening method stems from the low prevalence of the disease in the general population.

As discussed previously, serum CA125 levels have a low sensitivity for Stage I disease and a low specifi city when used in premenopausal women. Th is low sensitivity and specifi city combined with the low prevalence of ovarian cancer means that serum CA125 is limited as a screening tool as it has a low positive predictive value. In order to enhance the eff ectiveness of CA125 as a screening tool it has been used in conjunction with ultrasound in so-called multimodal screening. In a systematic review of the literature, Bell et al analyzed four prospective, nonrandomized studies using multimodal screening for ovarian cancer in the general population.22 Over 27,000 women were screened with 14 ovarian cancers being detected. Seven of the 14 ovarian cancers diagnosed were Stage 1 disease.",

Th e results of these studies will not be known for many years. CA125 to Evaluate a Pelvic Mass Several retrospective studies have demonstrated that CA125 levels can assist in predicting whether a pelvic mass is benign or malignant.25,26 Schutter et al reported on the results of a prospective multicenter study involving 228 postmenopausal women with pelvic masses evaluated by CA125, transvaginal ultrasound and pelvic examination.27 Th e accuracy of an elevated CA125 (>35 U/mL) in diff erentiating between a benign and malignant process was 77%. Th is approximated the accuracy using pelvic examination (76%) or transvaginal ultrasound alone (74%).",

Importantly, no malignancy was detected in any of the women in whom all three tests were con- sidered either negative or not indicative of a malignant process. Th erefore CA125 contributes important preoperative information to guide the management of a pelvic mass, particularly in the postmenopausal setting, as an elevated value alerts the physician to a higher likelihood of the presence of a malignancy. Th e American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recently suggested that if a premenopausal woman with a pelvic mass has a CA125 of >200 U/L consideration should be given to consultation with or referral to a gynecological oncologist.28 In 1993, Davies et al suggest the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) which consisted of an algorithm combining menopausal status, ultrasound appearance of the pelvic mass and the absolute CA125 level as a triage tool predict whether a pelvic mass would be malignant or not.",

Th is eff ect may be related to small admixtures of asbestos, which is related to mesothe- liomas. Overall this impact is minor.14 Regardless, both endometriosis and infl ammatory reaction are thought to contribute to the development of OC by causing transformation of the cells on the ovarian surface. Protective Factors Most protective factors supposedly decrease the risk for OC by reducing the number of ovulations, decreasing gonadotropin secretion or increasing progesterone levels.15 Increasing parity would lead to a lower risk through both mechanisms since pregnancy stops ovulation, decreases gonadotropin secretion and increases progesterone. Th e fi rst pregnancy grants a 40% reduction in risk and each subsequent pregnancy decreases the risk 10-15%. Th e Nurses Health Study found a relative risk of 0.84 per pregnancy.",

HPV is a circular double stranded DNA virus that contains 7 early (E1-E7) and 2 late (L1-L2) open read frames. E6 and E7 oncoproteins maintain the transformed phenotype and interact with tumor suppressor gene products. E6 proteins inactivate the p53 gene product, while E7 activates the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product (Fig. 1.3). In conclusion, understanding the molecular basis of tumor carcinogenesis al- lows for exciting development of cancer prevention and targeted therapies. Tumor “signatures” to predict responses to therapy and to identify novel tumor markers are under current investigation using microarray and proteomic technologies.

Currently, in the United States, the HPV test is not recommended as a stand alone screening test; however there are ongoing large prospective trials to further elucidate a role in screening. For example, 44,000 women in the Netherlands have already enrolled in POBASCAM (population-based randomized controlled trial for implementation of high risk HPV testing in cervical cancer screening) that will help determine whether HPV testing can supplant cervical cytology.8 In the near future, perhaps the advent of the new HPV vaccines may change the screening recommendations but further data will be required before any alterations are endorsed. Two companies have demonstrated exciting advances in the ability of HPV vaccines (one targeted against HPV 16 and 18, another against HPV Types 16, 18, 6 and 11) to prevent HPV infection and subsequent cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia. Multiple questions remain including, whether universal vaccinations will be recom- mended and who will pay for them, the length of protection that is aff orded by the vaccinations and how Pap tests will be performed in the vaccinated population.",

Screening can be discontinued following hysterectomy for benign reasons, not including cervical dysplasia, or for women over 70 without risk factors. Ovarian Cancer Screening An eff ective screening test is needed more in ovarian cancer than perhaps in any other gynecologic malignancy. Ovarian cancer will strike about 22,000 U.S. women in 2008 and an estimated 15,000 will succumb to the disease.1 Unfortunately, the high mortality due to the disease can be directly attributed to the fact that the 75-80% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer will have Stage III and IV disease. Overall 5-year survival for women with Stage III and IV disease are 30% and 17% respectively compared to 80-90% fi ve-year survival for women with Stage I disease.",

Uterine Cancer Uterine cancer will aff ect over 40,000 women in the United States in 2008 and over 95% of these will involve the endometrium (endometrial cancer) rather than the myometrium (sarcomas).1 In contrast to ovarian cancer, women with endometrial cancer are most oft en diagnosed in early stages due to the fact that they will have abnormal bleeding and seek medical attention. Currently, there is no recommended screening test for endometrial cancer in the general population, but if abnormal bleeding is reported, prompt evaluation with an endometrial biopsy and/or pelvic ultrasound is of paramount importance. Endometrial cancer risk factors include obesity, unopposed estrogen, tamoxifen treatment, diabetes, hypertension, along with genetic alterations; the presence of any of these factors should alert clinicians to potential endometrial pathology.",

Currently, in the United States, the HPV test is not recommended as a stand alone screening test; however there are ongoing large prospective trials to further elucidate a role in screening. For example, 44,000 women in the Netherlands have already enrolled in POBASCAM (population-based randomized controlled trial for implementation of high risk HPV testing in cervical cancer screening) that will help determine whether HPV testing can supplant cervical cytology.8 In the near future, perhaps the advent of the new HPV vaccines may change the screening recommendations but further data will be required before any alterations are endorsed. Two companies have demonstrated exciting advances in the ability of HPV vaccines (one targeted against HPV 16 and 18, another against HPV Types 16, 18, 6 and 11) to prevent HPV infection and subsequent cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia.",

Multiple questions remain including, whether universal vaccinations will be recom- mended and who will pay for them, the length of protection that is aff orded by the vaccinations and how Pap tests will be performed in the vaccinated population. In summary, cervical cancer screening with a Pap test is still recommended every 1-3 years in all women starting at 3 years aft er initiation of sexual activity but no later than age 21. Screening can be discontinued following hysterectomy for benign reasons, not including cervical dysplasia, or for women over 70 without risk factors. Ovarian Cancer Screening An eff ective screening test is needed more in ovarian cancer than perhaps in any other gynecologic malignancy. Ovarian cancer will strike about 22,000 U.S. women in 2008 and an estimated 15,000 will succumb to the disease.1 Unfortunately, the high mortality due to the disease can be directly attributed to the fact that the 75-80% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer will have Stage III and IV disease.",

Overall 5-year survival for women with Stage III and IV disease are 30% and 17% respectively compared to 80-90% fi ve-year survival for women with Stage I disease. To date, there is not an accepted or recommended screening regimen for women with ovarian cancer although several modalities have been in screening trials for years including transvaginal ultrasonography, CA125 testing and, more recently, serum proteonomics. Currently, neither the American Cancer Society, nor the USPSTF, nor ACOG recommend routine screening for ovarian cancer. Part of the diffi culty in proving the effi cacy of a screening method stems from the low prevalence of the disease in the general population.

Currently, there is no recommended screening test for endometrial cancer in the general population, but if abnormal bleeding is reported, prompt evaluation with an endometrial biopsy and/or pelvic ultrasound is of paramount importance. Endometrial cancer risk factors include obesity, unopposed estrogen, tamoxifen treatment, diabetes, hypertension, along with genetic alterations; the presence of any of these factors should alert clinicians to potential endometrial pathology.",

As discussed previously, serum CA125 levels have a low sensitivity for Stage I disease and a low specifi city when used in premenopausal women. Th is low sensitivity and specifi city combined with the low prevalence of ovarian cancer means that serum CA125 is limited as a screening tool as it has a low positive predictive value. In order to enhance the eff ectiveness of CA125 as a screening tool it has been used in conjunction with ultrasound in so-called multimodal screening. In a systematic review of the literature, Bell et al analyzed four prospective, nonrandomized studies using multimodal screening for ovarian cancer in the general population.22 Over 27,000 women were screened with 14 ovarian cancers being detected.

Th is eff ect may be related to small admixtures of asbestos, which is related to mesothe- liomas. Overall this impact is minor.14 Regardless, both endometriosis and infl ammatory reaction are thought to contribute to the development of OC by causing transformation of the cells on the ovarian surface. Protective Factors Most protective factors supposedly decrease the risk for OC by reducing the number of ovulations, decreasing gonadotropin secretion or increasing progesterone levels.15 Increasing parity would lead to a lower risk through both mechanisms since pregnancy stops ovulation, decreases gonadotropin secretion and increases progesterone. Th e fi rst pregnancy grants a 40% reduction in risk and each subsequent pregnancy decreases the risk 10-15%. Th e Nurses Health Study found a relative risk of 0.84 per pregnancy.",

Th e estrogen can be in- ternally produced and therefore conditions such as early menarche or late menopause that prolong the duration of estrogen exposure, oft en without adequate progesterone production, can increase risk. Obesity is another major risk factor and at least 50% of patients with endometrial cancer are overweight. Th e excess adipose tissue contributes to peripheral conversion of estrogen precursors into estradiol, insulin resistance, ovarian androgen excess, anovulation and chronic progesterone defi ciency.

Aft er 1 year of unopposed estrogen therapy, 20-50% of women will develop endometrial hyperplasia.

Th ere are over 100 types of the HPV virus, some of which infect the genital tract and are sexually transmitted. Among these there are types leading to integration of the HPV DNA into the host genome which interferes with gene function, specifi cally with p53 gene function, thus pro- moting the development of dysplasia, a precancerous lesion also known as cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN). Among the high risk types, HPV 16 and18 are the most frequent.29 Low risk HPV types remain episomal and do not increase the risk of malignancy, although they may give rise to genital condyloma.",

Persistent infection with HPV has now been shown to have a causal relationship with severe cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical cancer. Th e incidence of HPV is hard to predict since many cases are subclinical. An estimated 30 million cases of genital HPV infection are diagnosed each year worldwide, and at least half of the cases are in individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years. While nearly 80% of newly diagnosed cases are cleared within 8 to 12 months, women with high risk HPV types are more likely to have persistent infections and develop cervical cancer. Risk factors for acquiring HPV are similar to other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as a history of multiple sexual partners, early age at fi rst intercourse, a history of STDs, high parity, drug use, alcohol consumption and a higher frequency of vaginal intercourse.21,28-32 Even aft er treatment for CIN, the risk of invasive cervical cancer remains approximately 56/100,000.33 Nearly all other risk factors for cervical cancer are important mostly due to their infl uence on HPV infections.",

In patients over 55 years, there typically is no history or STD or tobacco use. In these patients, HPV DNA is found only in about 15%.19,37,38 While vulvar intra-epithelial neoplasia (VIN) has traditionally been thought to rarely progress to invasive disease, recent studies have shown that approximately 9% of untreated patients with VIN III will progress to invasion over 12-96 months and occult invasion was found in 20% of patients at the time of treatment for presumed VIN III.

In the American population, African-Americans have a rate of CC two times higher than Caucasians and the overall age adjusted incidence was 1.78 per million women.48 Risk Factors Since choriocarcinoma usually follows GTD, it stands to reason that the risk factors for molar pregnancy would also contribute to the risk for trophoblastic malignancies. Risk for GTD has been shown to be age related. Higher rates occur in women under 20 and over 40 possibly secondary to defects in premature or postmature ovarian function. Smoking has also been positively correlated with an increased risk for trophoblastic disease with a relative risk of 2.6 for patients who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day and a relative risk of 4.3 if they have smoked for at least 10 years when compared to non- smokers. Maternal blood type has also been implicated: patients with Type B blood have a higher incidence of recurrent GTD.",

Other risk factors that have been examined are the age at fi rst pregnancy, a history of induced abortions or spontaneous miscarriages, spacing between pregnancies, infertility, paternal age, a history of twins, diet and oral contraceptive use. For choriocarcinoma specifi cally, the strongest risk factor is a history of a complete molar pregnancy. With this condition, the risk is 1000 times higher than the risk with a normal pregnancy. Even when compared to partial moles which have an incidence of 0.1-0.5%, the incidence of CC following a complete mole is much higher (up to 20%).

Given this association some have hypothesized that the below normal levels of estrogen driven by OCPs can predispose to choriocarcinoma. Blood type has also been investigated, but in contrast to GTD, patients with Type A blood or a partner with an incompatible blood type seem to have a higher risk of CC.48 Survival Prior to the advent of combined chemotherapy, mortality rates for CC used to approach 80%.

In malignant tumors these factors are primarily pro-angiogenic, in fact for a tumor to grow more than 2 mm in diameter new blood vessels must grow to feed the tumor.1,2 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) along with its receptors, VEGFR-1 (FLT-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR) are part of a potent pro-angiogenic pathway involved in physiological as well as pathological angiogenesis.3,4 Tumor angiogenesis seems to be regulated primarily by VEGF and VEGFR-2. Bevacizumab (Avastin®), a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF (Fig. 5.2), was approved to treat colon cancer in 2005. It starves tumors by inhibiting new blood vessel formation therefore blocking nutrient delivery. It has been shown to extend overall survival by 5 months when added to stan- dard fi rst-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer.5 Bevacizumab has also shown an increase in survival time in breast and lung cancer patients when combined with traditional cytotoxic therapy.6,7 Even though the use of bevacizumab in gynecologic cancers has not been FDA approved, some exciting results have been reported in recent trials in ovarian cancer.",

Th e therapeutic radiation generated by a LINAC is on the order of MeV or million electron volts. For historical reasons, mg-Ra eq (milligram equivalents of radium) is used to express the exposure rate of a radioactive source. However, the modern way to calibrate and specify brachytherapy sources is air kerma strength which has the units: μGy m2 h-1. Photons versus Electrons Th e photons generated by a LINAC are in the megavoltage range, unlike diagnostic X-rays which are in the kilovoltage range. At the megavoltage energy level, photons are deeply penetrating. Because of this, photons are frequently used to treat pelvic targets. In addition, deeply penetrating photons only deposit a fraction of their energy on the skin; this is referred to as the “skin sparing” eff ect. Th e benefi t of the skin sparing eff ect is that patients do not get severe radiation skin reactions.",

One drawback is that superfi cial lesions may be underdosed unless a bolus of tissue equivalent material (usually 0.5-1 cm thick) is placed over them. On the other hand, electrons penetrate tissue to a limited degree and are mainly used for superfi cial targets such as the skin or in some cases the inguinal lymph nodes. A rule of thumb for electrons is that they are clinically useful to a depth that equals a fourth of their energy. At this depth, approximately 90% of the maximum dose is delivered. For example, 12 MeV electrons are useful to a 3 cm depth, 9 MeV to 2.25 cm and so on.

If splitting the radiation dose into daily fractions kills fewer tumor cells than if delivered in one big fraction, what is the advantage of fractionation? Th e answer lies in what happens to the normal tissue. Th e dashed black line in Figure 7.2 represents the normal tissue tolerance level; that is, any cell survival below this line would result in unacceptable normal tissue toxicity. A single fraction of 6 Gy delivers this maximum normal tissue dose and is illustrated by point A. Th e corresponding tumor survival is shown by point B. On the other hand, if one gives 2 Gy daily fractions, 10 Gy can safely be delivered without exceeding the normal tissue tolerance as shown by point C and the corresponding tumor survival is given by point D.",

As more fractions are delivered, the gap between the fractionated normal tissue and tumor curves become wider at a faster rate than their corresponding single fraction curves. In other words, aft er multiple treat- ment fractions, a larger proportion of tumor cells than normal cells are killed than if we delivered single fractions. Th is represents a therapeutic gain.

For example, in cervical cancer, repopulation and accelerated repopulation are thought to be responsible for the reduction in local control as treatment time is prolonged. Well-oxygenated cells are more radiosensitive than hypoxic cells by a factor of 2 to 3. Reoxygenation occurs when the radioresistant hypoxic cells in the central por- tion of tumor become oxygenated between treatments. One explanation is that the well-oxygenated radiosensitive cells at the periphery of the tumor are preferentially killed by radiation. As these peripheral cells die, the tumor diameter decreases and former central hypoxic cells become part of the tumor’s well-oxygenated periphery.

In clinical practice, the inherent radiosensitivity of an individual or the radioresistance of tumors is not known. Doses are prescribed based on the clinical data accumulated on thousands of patients over many years. Dose Rate Eff ect Not only is the total dose important in determining the chance of tumor control, but the rate at which it is delivered is also important. Th is is particularly relevant in brachytherapy where a wide range of dose rates can be achieved depending on the isotope and its activity. Th e dose rate eff ect is mostly dependent on the half-times of the four R’s of radiobiology. In general, repair has the shortest half-time, followed by reassortment, reoxygenation and repopulation.

Th e purpose of the treat- ment simulation is to ensure a highly reproducible therapy that the patient can undergo. A treatment simulator is an apparatus with a diagnostic X-ray tube that duplicates the LINAC in terms of its mechanical, geometrical and optical properties (see Fig. 7.10). Most simulators have fl uoroscopic ability and enable real-time visualization of the anatomy. Since the simulator can clearly show the bony anatomy in most cases, it can be very useful when determining the treatment fi eld for bone palliation without the need of sophisticated computer planning. In many cases, the simulation consists of obtaining a CT scan in the treatment position that is imported into the treatment planning computer.",

On the other hand, in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the intensity profi le of the photon beam is varied or modulated to meet the goals of the treatment plan. Th e modulation of the photon beam is oft en achieved with the use of a multileaf collimator. IMRT requires careful outlining of the treatment target and careful outlining of normal structures within any part of the irradiated volume. Typically fi ve to nine beams are arranged around the target using strategically chosen gantry angles. Th e planning computer then optimizes the intensity profi le of each beam so that the coverage of the target is maximized while the treatment of normal structures is minimized. Th is process is computer intensive and is termed “inverse planning”. Compared to traditional techniques, IMRT is sometimes advantageous because a higher dose gradient between the target and the normal tissues can be accomplished. Th is sharper dose gradient could translate into better sparing of normal structures and safer delivery of higher doses to the target than conventional treatments.",

Fletcher-Suit LDR Brachytherapy Technique Th e Fletcher-Suit LDR (low dose rate) brachytherapy technique is commonly used in patients diagnosed with cervical cancer to deliver a high dose boost to the uterine cervix and parametria. It may be used alone in very early disease. When used as a boost, a four-fi eld photon teletherapy technique fi rst treats the pelvis to a dose of 4000 to 5000 cGy. Th is is typically followed by two Fletcher-Suit brachytherapy treatments. Th e fi rst Fletcher-Suit treatment is delivered aft er the completion of pelvic teletherapy and the second is delivered 1 or 2 weeks later, so that the entire treatment course is completed within 8 weeks. The Fletcher-Suit applicator consists of a central tube, called the tandem, and two lateral ovoids (see Figs. 7.14 and 7.15). A small part called the flange is subse- quently attached to the tandem during the implant partly to prevent the tandem from going too far and perforating the uterus. The ovoids are separated from each other by spacers or caps. All the components are held together with special fittings.",

Each ovoid is usually loaded with one source of 15 mg-Ra eq. The dose distribution will be “pear shaped”, with the dose ballooning out at the cervix due to the ovoid dose contribution.

Skin: desquamation of the skin can manifest as a fl aky peeling of the epidermis termed dry desquamation or moist desquamation (see Fig. 7.19). Moisturizers can provide rapid relief of dry desquamation and should not contain chemical irritants. Dry desquamation can progress to moist desquamation when there is total loss of the epidermis. Moist desquamation manifests as serous weeping of the skin and can be painful and associated with an increased risk of infection. Moist desquamation occurs more frequently in areas like the inguinal area because the skin folds act as a bolus and eliminate the photons’ skin sparing eff ect.

In 2001, the ASCCP established evidence based guidelines for biopsy proven CIN management and follow-up17 (see Fig. 8.2). In general, CIN 1 lesions are managed conservatively, given that up to one-half will spontaneously regress. Close follow-up is indicated and consists of either cytology at 6 and 12 months or HPV DNA testing at 12 months. Colposcopy and cytology at 12 months is also considered an acceptable form of follow-up. If the result of follow-up testing is negative, then the patient may return to the previous screening method. If the severity of CIN worsens in the follow-up period, then that patient should undergo treatment.",

Th e management of persistent CIN 1 is controversial, given that the likeli- hood of progression to cancer is low. Follow-up and treatment are both viable options and the ultimate decision to treat persistent CIN 1 may ultimately come down to physician and patient preference. If the patient desires treatment, either excisional or ablative therapy is considered appropriate.15-18 In general, a diagnosis of CIN 2 or 3 requires some form of treatment.17 Th e treatment of pre-invasive cervical disease generally falls into two categories: ablative therapy and excisional therapy. A recent meta-analysis of treatment modalities for CIN suggests that all therapies are largely equivalent in treating pre-invasive disease.19 Ablative therapy, however, is contraindicated in the presence of endocervical disease or if prior colposcopy was unsatisfactory. Regardless of the modality employed, the entire transformation zone should be treated.17 Figure. 8.3.",

Colposcopy must be performed at the time of “see and treat” to exclude an obvious invasive carcinoma. Although patients must be counseled on the risk of overtreatment with this strategy, this may be a viable option in the patient at risk for noncompliance.25 Pregnant women with biopsy confi rmed CIN should be managed conservatively until aft er delivery. CIN tends to regress at a high rate with delivery, sparing the patient the risks associated with therapy during pregnancy. However, pregnant women with a diagnosis of microinvasion should undergo a diagnostic conization even during pregnancy and further treatment planning should be based on the results of conization.17 Th e optimal mode of management of adolescents with biopsy proven CIN is unknown. However, it is generally agreed that adolescents with biopsy proven CIN 2 or less can be observed conservatively with colposcopy and cytology at 4 to 6 month intervals, provided that colposcopy is satisfactory, there is no endocervical disease and there is a reasonable expectation of compliance.",

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of a vaccine directed against prevalent HPV types will not only reduce the incidence of HPV infection but also reduce the incidence of HPV related CIN.26,27 In June 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an- nounced the approval of Gardasil® for the prevention cervical cancer, precancerous genital lesions and genital warts due to human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 6, 11, 16 and 18.

Cure rates in patients treated for CIN are variable and tend to be higher in patients receiving excisional therapy.

A combination of cytology and colposcopy is also considered acceptable.18 Vulvar Intra-Epithelial Neoplasia (VIN) Pre-invasive disease of the vulva is, like CIN, considered a precursor lesion of vulvar carcinoma. Like CIN, VIN is classifi ed as mild (VIN 1), moderate (VIN 2), or severe (VIN 3). Its age distribution is considered bimodal, with peak incidences occurring in the third and seventh decades of life. Like CIN, there is a strong as- sociation between high risk HPV DNA infection and VIN.28 Lichen sclerosis and other nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva are also associated with the development of VIN, as are cigarette smoking, HIV infection and immunosuppres- sion.",

However, because of the asymptomatic nature of VIN lesions, there is oft en a delay in diagnosis. VIN lesions may appear as red, white, or pigmented areas on the vulva. Any abnormal appearing lesion on the vulva suspicious for VIN should be biopsied without hesitation.

Also, women that had a hysterectomy for CIN or early cervical carcinoma may have also had dysplastic extension into the vagina that wasn’t recognized at the time of surgery or subsequently developed aft erwards. Given that vaginal cancer is a relatively rare malignancy, the malignant potential of VAIN is considered relatively low.36 VAIN is usually asymptomatic and detected at the time of cytologic screening. Sometimes VAIN will present as an abnormal vaginal discharge or vaginal spotting. Colposcopy of the vagina followed by biopsy of any abnormality is required for diag- nosis. Colposcopy should be performed in the same manner as that performed for the cervix. Lugol’s solution may also be used at the time colposcopy with biopsies performed on a nonstaining area of the vagina. Treating VAIN requires complete eradication of the abnormal vaginal epithelium.

As with treatment of VIN, side eff ects of topical 5-FU are troublesome and may prompt discontinuation of therapy.40 Conclusion Since the advent of the Pap smear, there have many advances in the diagnosis and management of pre-invasive disease of the female genital tract. Th e recent development of HPV directed vaccine therapy will possibly have a dramatic impact on the incidence of pre-invasive disease over the next several decades. Future research in this area will be directed towards targeting additional HPV types in a single vaccine. Access to vaccine therapy and other therapeutics is a major problem worldwide, and future resources will need to be utilized to provide therapy to the world’s underserved areas, such as south- east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.",

Conization and simple hysterectomy generally are associated with a low risk of complications and minimal blood loss. Radical hysterec- tomy is associated with an average blood loss of 750 cc, a 1-2% risk of ureterovaginal or vesicovaginal fi stulas and an overall slightly higher risk of postoperative complica- tions than seen with simple hysterectomy. Bladder dysfunction and inability to void is common aft er radical hysterectomy, requiring bladder retraining and intermittent self-catheterization. Radiation is associated with loss of ovarian function in all patients and a 5-10% rate of bowel and bladder complications, which include hemorrhagic cys- titis, radiation proctitis and enteritis, malabsorption and bowel obstruction.",

Duration of treatment is typically between 6 and 8 weeks. Patients whose duration of therapy extends beyond 8 weeks have higher rates of disease persistence and recurrence. Th erefore, treatment time should be kept to a minimum and treatment breaks should be avoided. Anemia during treatment is also an important prognostic indicator. Patients whose hemoglobin level falls to 10.0 at the time of diagnosis or lower at any time during radiation therapy have lower response rates, higher recurrence rates and lower overall survival. Anemia should be aggressively treated during radiation, although the type of treatment is at the treating physician’s discretion.",

Current areas of study include newer radiation techniques, the use of biologics either along with chemoradiation or in the setting of recurrence and chemotherapy combinations in recurrent disease. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses multiple radiation beams to try to more specifi cally target the cancerous tissues and minimize the toxicity to the normal surrounding tissues.

C) Adenocarcinoma that show more than 50% solid growth are graded as poorly differenti- ated. The glandular pattern may be hardly recognizable and the cells are arranged in solid sheets and cords.

In the vast majority of cases, the architectural and nuclear grades correspond. In the rare cases where they are at variance and the nuclei show bizarre nuclear atypia (‘notable nuclear atypia’ WHO), the nuclear grade is the more reliable indicator of prognosis and raises the grade by one.

A recent analysis of 39,451 breast cancer patients found that women who had received Tamoxifen therapy had a RR of 4.62 for developing a subsequent uterine carcinosarcoma compared to women not receiving Tamoxifen.5 Clinical Presentation As with the more common endometrial cancers, the most likely symptom for women with all histologic subtypes of uterine sarcoma is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Between 75-95% of patients will present with complaints of postmenopausal bleed- ing or menometrorrhagia. Approximately 10% of women will complain of discharge without bleeding and 10% of women will complain of pain and/or a mass. Th e triad of vaginal bleeding, pain and tumor fungating from the external cervical os has been found to be strongly associated with the diagnosis of carcinosarcoma.

One study found that only 0.27% of women undergoing hysterectomy for a rapidly enlarging fi broid were found to have a leiomyosarcoma.6 Diagnosis Most uterine carcinosarcomas are diagnosed preoperatively by either an endometrial biopsy or dilatation and curettage. Th ey may also be commonly diagnosed by a simple biopsy if there is tumor prolapsing from the cervix. Occasionally carcinosarcomas are not diagnosed until aft er hysterectomy because the preoperative endometrial sampling only identifi es the carcinomatous component of the mixed tumor. Leiomyosarcomas, conversely, are diagnosed preoperatively in less than half of the cases. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally on postoperative pathology. Endometrial sampling most likely misses the tumor because it arises within the muscle wall of the uterus and not the lining of the uterus which is sampled by the endometrial biopsy.",

Th e recommended treatment for adenosarcomas is total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and sampling of peritoneal washings (Fig. 11.5). A modifi ed radical hysterectomy may need to be performed when there is tumor extension to the parametrial tissue or if there is suspicion of involvement of the lower uterine segment or cervix.

Histology Approximately 65-70% of all ovarian malignancies are epithelial, with germ cell tumors (25%), sex cord stromal tumors (5%) and metastatic tumors to the ovaries (<5%) accounting for the remainder. Epithelial ovarian malignancies arise from the glandular epithelium of the ovary and are classifi ed as adenocarcinomas. Histologic subtypes include serous, mucinous, endometrioid, transitional-cell, or clear-cell histology. Serous tumors are the most common subtype, comprising approximately 46% of all epithelial ovarian carcinomas, with mucinous tumors being the second most common.

Clear-cell tumors, which comprise 3% of epithelial ovarian carcinomas, have the poorest prognosis and are the only histological subtype that independently predicts poorer survival.

Of women with Stage I disease, 5-year survival approaches 95%, while for those with Stage III/IV, the survival falls to 20-30% (Fig. 12.3). For both early and advanced stage ovarian cancer, surgery is a mainstay of treat- ment and has two specifi c goals: complete staging and cytoreduction. Establishing the stage of a malignancy, as well as the full extent of disease, is an essential component to treatment, including eligibility for treatment protocols. In 1986 the Federation of International Gynecologic Oncologists (FIGO) established strict criteria for the surgical staging of ovarian cancer. Figure 12.3.

Patients with Stage IA and IB tumors that have Grade 3 histology or any patients with Stage IC disease carry an unfavorable prog- nosis and it is recommended that they receive at least three cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy with paclitaxel.

Successfully achieving optimal cytoreduction at the time of initial surgery varies between 20-80%, although it is generally higher when performed by subspecialists in gynecologic oncology.

Prevention Chemoprevention Th e prevention of ovarian cancer is an area of increasing interest. In genetically uncharacterized women in the United States, the life-time risk of developing ovar- ian cancer is approximately 1.5%.

Biochemical markers of transformation, including cell cycle progression and apop- tosis, serving as surrogate endpoint markers, have potential utility in future ovarian cancer chemoprevention trials. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are estimated to reduce the overall risk of ovarian cancer by approximately 40%. Little is known about the mechanism of the protective eff ect of OCPs against ovarian cancer, although it has been postulated that a major mechanism of OCP protection relates to a decrease in ovulatory cycles. Th ere is data to suggest that an increased rate of apoptosis in aberrant epithelial cells secondary to the progestational component may also play an important role. Th e degree of protection and the length of protection appear to be associated with the duration of OCP usage. One of the largest case-control studies to date is the Centers for Disease Control Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study.

Th e fi mbriated end is the most common site of early serous carcinoma of the Fallopian tube in women with BRCA mutations, thus allowing for the recommendation of a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without hysterectomy in these high-risk women.17 Surgical Staging Defi nitive management of Fallopian tube carcinoma is guided by the course of disease spread. Initially, malignant cells grow and invade through the Fallopian tube lumen as well as directly into the remainder of the adnexa and uterus. Exfoliation of malignant cells by either transcoelomic spread or passage through the tubal fi mbriae leads to seeding of the abdominal cavity. In contrast, lymphatic drainage leads to in- volvement of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.",

A number of small series have demonstrated a high percentage of women conceiving following the surgical and chemotherapeutic management of GCT without increased pregnancy complica- tions or teratogenicity. Metastatic Tumors Five to six percent of ovarian tumors are metastatic. Metastatic tumors are commonly bilateral and solid, although cystic areas may be present. Krukenberg tumors account for a high proportion of metastatic ovarian tumors. Th ese tumors are characterized by mucinous signet-ring cells within ovarian stroma. Historically, this histology was associated with tumors arising in the stomach. With the decreasing incidence of gastric cancer in western countries, colon, breast and biliary signet-ring metastatic tumors have been described. Breast cancer and colorectal cancer are the most common primary tumors associated with ovarian metastasis. Nonovarian gynecologic tumors, including Fallopian tube, endometrial and rarely cervical carci- nomas may directly extend to the ovaries as well.",

As with cervical carcinoma, chemosen- sitization should be considered when treating women with vaginal cancer with primary radiotherapy. Intracavitary brachytherapy uses a vaginal or uterine applicator/tandem devices to deliver a radioactive source to the tumor, and interstitial brachytherapy (ITB) uses a template with a series of needles implanted through the perineum and loaded with radiation sources. Interstitial brachytherapy is important in more regionally advanced and irregular tumors where dose-rate distributions are calculated by means of computer-assisted optimization of the source placement and strength. 3.

Chemotherapy in vaginal cancer is poorly studied, but most would use a cervical cancer regimen including cisplatin. Future Directions Vaginal cancer is a rare tumor. Large trials examining newer treatments for this cancer are unlikely given the rarity, but newer treatments for the more common cervical cancer can oft en be extrapolated to this disease. Most recently, treatments incorporat- ing radiosensitizers such as cisplatin for vaginal cancer based on cervical cancer data is being employed. As newer chemotherapies and targeted agents including vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, kinase inhibitors and epidermal growth factor inhibitors are examined in cervical cancer, it is likely that we will see more agents used in the treatment of vaginal cancer.\n18 205 Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Figure 18.2.

Ultrasound monitoring of the pregnancy should be repeated to exclude retroplacental hematoma, other placental abnormalities, or degenerating myoma and to fully evaluate the fetoplacental unit for evidence of a partial mole or gross fetal malformations. If the diagnosis is still suspected and con- tinuation of pregnancy is desired, fetal karyotype should be obtained, a chest X-ray performed to screen for metastases and serial serum hCG values should be followed. If fetal karyotype is normal, major fetal malformations are excluded by ultrasound and there is no evidence of metastatic disease, it is reasonable to allow the pregnancy to continue unless pregnancy-related complications force delivery.",

Digestion of proteins occurs mainly in the duodenum but can occur at any level of the small bowel. Hence, protein malabsorption is rare even aft er extensive intestinal resection. Th e main site of protein turnover is the GI tract, as mucosal cells are shed and digestive enzymes are secreted into enteric content the majority of which is re- absorbed. Excessive GI tract losses usually occur through abnormal communications of the GI tract through a fi stula, an ileostomy, a draining gastrostomy, or short gut syndrome from extensive bowel resection.

Th e gracilis myocutaneous fl ap (Fig. 20A.5) has been used since the late 1970s for neovaginal and vulvar reconstructions aft er radical pelvic procedures.2-4 Both a well-de- fi ned primary vascular pedicle derived from the medial femoral circumfl ex artery and a poorly-defi ned accessory blood supply derived from anastomotic terminal branches of the obturator and pudendal arteries close to the origin of the gracilis muscle supply this fl ap.3,4 Because of the length of the fl ap and its wide arc of rotation, it is a versatile fl ap for pelvic reconstruction. Occasionally, it is used for reconstruction of vulvar or groin defects, or the gracilis muscle alone is used for reconstruction of vaginal fi stulas or aft er disruption of the rectal sphincter. Th e thin strap-like gracilis muscle is the most medial adductor of the thigh. It functions to stabilize the knee medially, but can be sacrifi ced without loss of function. Th e gracilis originates from the pubic tubercle and extends posterior to the adductor longus to insert into the medial tibial plateau.",

Trachelectomy Radical trachelectomy, which involves excision of the cervix, proximal parametrium and a cuff of vaginal mucosa, is a fertility-sparing procedure performed in young women with small tumors. It is preceded by a laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy and only performed if the nodes are negative for metastatic disease. Pioneered and refi ned by Dargent and colleagues,21 extensive work has been done by a Canadian group with this select patient population. Plante, Roy and colleagues reported 82 patients with Stage IA, IB, or IIA cervical cancer who were scheduled to undergo vaginal radical trachelectomy, preceded by laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy and parametrectomy.22 Th e trachelectomy was aborted in 10 patients due to positive nodes or margins, or extensive tubal disease.",

However, there is consistent and reproducible evidence that the minimally invasive approach is better for patients in the short-term, without apparent adverse long-term outcomes. Ovarian Cancer In 1990, Reich et al reported the fi rst case of laparoscopic management of Stage I ovarian cancer.33 As ovarian cancer most commonly presents in Stage III, requiring extensive surgical debulking, it has been less amenable to exclusively laparoscopic man- agement. However, laparoscopy does have a valuable but limited role in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. Th e most common indications are: (1) histologic confi rmation of advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer, (2) second-look laparoscopy and (3) detection and staging or restaging of early ovarian cancer. Advanced Ovarian Cancer In patients presenting with stigmata of advanced ovarian cancer, an approach using neoadjuvant chemotherapy for presumed ovarian cancer has been advocated by some.",

As 10-20% of peritoneal carcinomatosis may be nonovarian in origin,34 laparoscopy can be used to obtain an accurate histologic diagnosis and guide therapy. Additionally, laparoscopy can be used to determine if optimal debulking, defi ned as removing all tumor 1 cm in size or larger, is feasible. Second-Look Laparoscopy A second-look operation has typically been performed by laparotomy in order to evaluate the response to chemotherapy, with or without prior debulking. Husain et al reviewed records of 150 patients who underwent second-look laparoscopy aft er a pre- vious open debulking and were clinically disease-free. Forty-six percent had negative second-look laparoscopies and their recurrence rate of 40% was equivalent to those who had second-look laparotomies. Th e rate of major complications was 2.7%.35 Clough et al performed second-look laparoscopies followed by laparotomies in 20 patients and found the positive predictive value of laparoscopy for fi nding residual disease to be 100% (6/6).",

Staging/Restaging Early Ovarian Cancer Early-stage ovarian cancer is oft en diffi cult to reliably diagnose preoperatively, but once identifi ed, lends itself to an exclusively laparoscopic approach.

Classically operative management of vulvar cancer would have consisted of the traditional radical vulvectomy with en bloc inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy performed through the classic butterfl y incision (Fig. 20C.5). Th is procedure was associated with a wound separation in approximately 50% of patients.1 Th e procedure has been modifi ed to a radical wide excision with lymphadenectomy via a separate incision technique (Fig. 20C.6). Th e modifi ed procedure is associated with similar cure rates, but signifi cantly less morbidity and a reduction in wound dehiscence to approximately 15%.1 Today the surgical procedure is oft en tailored based on tumor location, size and depth of Figure 20C.4.

As we strive to improve outcomes, the balance between cure and morbidity is a constant battle. Advances in surgical technology allow gynecologic oncologists to achieve similar if not better outcomes with decreased morbidity and improved quality of life for the patient. Probably the best example of this impact is the growing use and acceptance of laparoscopic approaches to gynecologic cancer surgeries. In the future, robotics can be expected to further these improvements. Also, through better understanding of the specifi c cancers and their spread patterns we can off er less radical techniques. Th e application of sentinel node techniques could further tailor our surgical approaches allowing for better outcomes. Suggested Reading 1. Berek et al.

Corticosteroids and progestational agents (e.g., megesterol acetate) can be employed to stimulate the appetite. If these are unsuccessful, dronabinol may be used. Nausea Nausea is oft en multifactorial and has a complex physiology and hence, may require multiple medications for optimal management. Nausea may contribute to anorexia. Physiologically, nausea can be related to gastrointestinal dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems, treatment itself and metabolic derangements. Gastrointestinal dysfunction can include oral thrush, delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis), carcinomatous ileus, ascites, or constipation. If ascites is present-paracentesis may be benefi cial for management of nausea. Neuropsychiatric problems, such as anxiety or brain metastasis, may also be contributory or causative. Treatment itself, such as chemotherapy, radiation, or medica- tions, can contribute to the sensation of nausea. As noted previously, changing the type of long-acting narcotic can improve symptoms. An attempt to decrease or discontinue all unnecessary medications should be made. Metabolic disturbances including uremia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia can also contribute to nausea.",
